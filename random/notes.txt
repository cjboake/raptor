STATSERVE - A fun webserver
=================================
_________________________________

*This would be a good place to pick up for a new project*

-> Use 'fork', not 'select' and look up: accept, bind,
listen, connect, socket, shutdown
-> Research 'echo server in C'
-> Beej's guide to network programming
-> Look up 'nc'


Outline of how to make a server:

-> Create a socket. This is a file that that acts as an endpoint for connecting an IP on a certain port.
-> You're going to need to bind this socket to a port. This is how you communicate with the machine.
-> To do this, you need a struct_info of some variety to provide the details of how your socket is going to operate.
-> the getaddrinfo method is a way of getting this struct, you give it the IP, port numbers, etc.
-> Once you have a socket, you'll need to run a loop that listens for attemps to connect.

Some notes from Zed's video:
===========================

-> create a sigaction that hangles SIGCHILD
-> listen on the port of the given host
-> Accept a client connection, then fork
-> if zero, then child
-> else server
-> do a hangler, so that when children die you wait on them

* Look into killing signal process children (waitpid, etc.)
