Statserve Server Project
========================

This is a little server that I'm playing with, 
and I have a few goals for it:

* To be able to accept requests and serv data.
* Have a functioning NoSQL database for storing my data.
* Utilize a series of custom commands or even simple
scripting to retrieve the data.

Once I can accomplish these things with it, it will
have the potential to expand into something much more
interesting.

This server will hopefully grow into as full service project
one day and be open for use by other people.
