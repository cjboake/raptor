Statserve Server Project
========================

This is a little server that I'm playing with, 
and I have a few goals for it:

* To be able to accept requests and serv data.
* Have a functioning NoSQL database for storing my data.
* Utilize a series of custom commands or even simple
scripting to retrieve the data.

Once I can accomplish these things with it, it will
have the potential to expand into something much more
interesting.
